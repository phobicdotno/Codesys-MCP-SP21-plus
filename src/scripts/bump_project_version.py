# primary project. Convention (per CODESYS / 3S / WAGO library practice):
#
#   Major     -- bump on incompatible API break.
#   Minor     -- bump on backward-compatible feature add.
#   Revision  -- bump on bug fix only (no API change).
#   Build     -- internal counter, often 0 for hand-released versions.
#
# Bumping a higher part resets all lower parts to 0 (e.g. bumping minor
# resets revision and build).
#
# The Version field is read/written as a property on the "Project
# Information" node (first child of the primary project). IronPython
# coerces strings like "1.2.3.4" to System.Version automatically; we
# stringify on the read side because str(System.Version) gives
# the dotted form back. None / empty are treated as "0.0.0.0".

# the online protocol despite zero IEC references, so a Symbol
# Configuration / 'symbol' attribute is NOT required for the runtime to
# expose unreferenced globals. The string is still effectively read-only
# at runtime since only bump_project_version updates it via

# running PLC reports its full library manifest -- not just the app version.
# Refreshed on
# every version bump (the release step), which is the point at which a library
# change should be recorded anyway. (Follow-up: call this same maintenance from
# add_library / remove_library so the manifest also refreshes on a bare lib
# change with no bump -- not yet wired.)
# Enumeration API (verified in list_project_libraries.py): walk the tree for
